As shown in Random_Forest_Segmentation notebook, Decision trees can be used as a segmentation tool, where each leaf represents a segment.<br>
But what if we want to divide our population into larger segments than model's leaves?<br>
Here, provided a very simple example , where Kc region in Seattle is divded into sub-regions. Each sub-region contains a few zipcodes:<br>

  1. Build a decision tree classifier: features are X and Y coordinates. labels are the zipcodes. Then, trim/prune the tree by defining lower maximal leaves number.
  2. ***Surplrisingly, as the tree becomes more pruned. Entropy criterion provides more evenly balanced leaves size than Gini index ***
  3. Finally, provided a function to extract from the decision tree the decision path for each sample.

Such a method can also be useful when we would like to convert clusters which were generated by unsupervised methods into simple decision rules (i.e. generate classifcation tree where label is the clusters, the extract their paths)
